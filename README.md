# Cards

**TODO: To learn about the basis of functional programming and the basic Elixir code structure**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `cards` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:cards, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Notes

* `iex -S mix` inside the directory where mix.exs is there to compile and run iex
